# Portfolio
## **Python deliverables**

- Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming conventions.

- Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.

- Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).

- All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

- Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.

- All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes
descriptive comments.

- All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.

- Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking
the top and the bottom of the dataframe.

- Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its
shape and basic statistics.

- All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge flag
shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.

- Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.

- All column names are self-explanatory.

- All identifier variables follow the industry standard data type.

- Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have
been checked and addressed.

- Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions flag has been created.

- All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a
consistent naming convention.

- Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.

- At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights
to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.

- Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to
customer information.

- Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the
questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.

- Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets.
